Creating an application that incorporates these topics is a great way to learn and gain practical experience. Here's a structured approach to help you get started:

### Project Overview

**Objective:** Develop a Haskell-based application with CI/CD integration using Docker, incorporating model-driven design principles. Optionally, integrate Lean for theorem proving.

**Steps to Follow:**

1. **Define the Application Scope:**
   - Choose a simple but meaningful application that allows you to explore all these areas. For example, a task management system, a basic web service, or a mathematical proof system.

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment:**
   - Install Haskell: [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)
   - Install Lean: [Lean Theorem Prover](https://leanprover.github.io/)
   - Set up Docker: [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
   - Choose an IDE: VSCode with Haskell and Docker extensions.

3. **Project Structure and Version Control:**
   - Initialize a Git repository.
   - Organize your project directory structure.
   - Create a `README.md` to document your project.

4. **Design Your Application:**
   - **Model-Driven Design:** Use UML diagrams to design your application models and architecture.
   - Define entities, relationships, and workflows.
   - Tools like [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) can be useful for this.

5. **Develop the Application in Haskell:**
   - Start by setting up a basic Haskell project using [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).
   - Implement core functionalities incrementally.
   - Write tests for your code to ensure reliability.

6. **Integrate Lean (Optional):**
   - If integrating Lean, use it to verify mathematical properties or proofs related to your application's logic.
   - Write Lean scripts and integrate them with your Haskell application.

7. **Dockerize the Application:**
   - Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize your Haskell application.
   - Ensure all dependencies are included in the Docker image.
   - Test the Docker container locally.

8. **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Use a CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Travis CI.
   - Configure the pipeline to build, test, and deploy your application automatically.
   - Integrate Docker into your CI/CD process.

9. **Deploy the Application:**
   - Deploy your application to a cloud service or server.
   - Use Docker Compose if you have multiple services.

10. **Documentation and Learning:**
   - Document your learning process, challenges, and solutions in a blog or journal.
   - Create detailed documentation for your application.

### Sample Project Plan
